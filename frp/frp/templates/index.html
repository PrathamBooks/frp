    <h3> About Pratham Books </h3>
    <p>
    <strong> Pratham Books </strong> is a non-profit organisation that publishes high quality,
    affordable books for children in multiple Indian languages. We believe 
    that every child has the right to enjoy good books with stories set in 
    surroundings familiar to them and in languages they speak and learn in. 
    We also believe that to make books accessible to every child, the price 
    points have to be very low. Pratham Books publishes storybooks as 
    Indian as the children who read them. As a not-for-profit publisher, our 
    dream is to see a country where every child wants to read, is able to 
    read, and has something good to read.<a href="http://www.prathambooks.org" target="_blank"> (more) </a>

    <h3>Success Stories</h3>

        So many more amazing books for children to read at the Deepalaya Community Library in Sheikh Sarai
      </a>
      </p>
      <p>
      Deepalaya Community Library's campaign to raise funds for children's books through Donate-a-Book has been a 
      roaring success. Isn't it amazing that just halfway into their campaign, they had already received 100% funding? 
      Within two weeks, books - handpicked by members of Deepalaya - were on their way to two of their centres in Delhi. 
      We've been told that children were visibly excited upon seeing the sheer number of boxes filled with books for 
      them, all made possible through their online fund-raising campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
      Deepalaya Community Library serves the residents of Sheikh Sarai and surrounding neighbourhoods with a collection 
      of over 3000 books. With the support of their members and volunteers, they also run the Reading Project which has 
      a strong focus on reading aloud to children.

    <img src="/static/images/Award.png" style="height:100px; width:100px; float:right">
    <p>
    Donate-a-Book was awarded the 'Publishing Innovation of the Year 2015' by 'Publishing Next' 
    for its ability to successfully leverage crowdsourcing and social media towards achieving its goal, 
    as well as for an innovative initiative that demonstrates a commitment to children's books, 
    both in Indian Languages and English.
